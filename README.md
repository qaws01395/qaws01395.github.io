I'm a normal coder. I previsouly work as an RA and full stack developer for [TIMELI(Traffic Incident Management Enabled by Large-data Innovations)](https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2017/03/22/timeli). And interned as open source contributor for [PEWI(People in Ecosystems Watershed Integration)](https://www.nrem.iastate.edu/pewi/). Luckily, got a Facebook offer this year. Excited to learn more from my first

Recently, I'm learning investment and more programming language through [Exercism](https://exercism.io/).

I like to play badminton or other sports and musical instrument like clarinet. Would like to learn piano, violin and cello. Furthermore, I'm thinking about trying out voice over.
